### consensus engine in relation to TFT Farming Rewards in TFGrid 3.0

!!!include:consensus3_overview_graph

The consensus engine checks the farming rules as defined in 

- [farming logic 3.0](threefold:farming_reward)
- [farming reward calculator](threefold:farming_calculator)

- if uptime + 99.5% per month then the TFT will be rewarded to the farmer.

All the data of the farmer and the 3nodes are registered in the tfgrid_db.

> being implemented for TFGrid 3.0 (H2 2021)
