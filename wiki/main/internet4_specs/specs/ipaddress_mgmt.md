# IP Address Management

All available ranges are stored on grid_db and link with farmer who owns it.

Its possible to see where the IP range is located and user can query based on location.

The pricing is on [cloudunits_pricing](threefold:cloudunits_pricing).

Each grid_user can reserve an ipaddress, registered on tfgrid_db.

Payment is also per hour just like any other resource.
