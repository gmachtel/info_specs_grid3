# Terraform

Threefold loves opensource! and now for version 3 we are integration with the most popular infrastructure as code tool [terraform](https://terraform.io) to allow utilizing the Threefold grid v3 using terraform to allow consistent workflow and familiar experience for everyone coming from different background. Terraform describes the state desired of how the deployment should look like instead of imperatively describing the low level details and the mechanics of how things should be glued together
