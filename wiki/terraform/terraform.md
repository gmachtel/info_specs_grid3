# Terraform

Threefold loves Open Source ! For version 3 we are integrating the most popular 'Infrastructure as Code' (IaC) tool [Terraform](https://terraform.io). Utilizing the Threefold Grid v3 using Terraform allows for a consistent workflow and familiar experience for everyone coming from different background. Terraform describes the state desired of how the deployment should look like instead of imperatively describing the low level details and the mechanics of how things should be glued together.
