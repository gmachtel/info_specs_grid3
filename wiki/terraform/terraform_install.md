### Terraform Install

Get Terraform from the [download page](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) on the official site, or install using you system's package manager.

There's no need to specifically install the ThreeFold Terraform plugin. Terraform will automatically load it from an online directory according to instruction within the deployment file.
