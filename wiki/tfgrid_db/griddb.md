# Threefold Grid Database

The puprose of the Grid Database on Substrate is to decentralise the way we work with identities.

Following identities are stored on Substrate:

- Entities (physical humain beings, only 1 entity per human).
- Twin (Digital Assistant).
- Farmers (Threefold grid Farmers).
- Node (Threefold grid physical Nodes).

A Twin object is digital representation of either a User, Node or a Farm. It facilitates a way to communicate against the chain.
